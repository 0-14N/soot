Toolkit to produce and manipulate various types control flow
graphs.  The CFGs can have as nodes any implementation of
<code>DirectedGraph</code>; typically, <code>Unit</code> elements
or <code>Block</code> elements.  The latter corresponds to basic
blocks of <code>Unit</code>s.  Some of the classes produce
<code>UnitGraph</code>s where the control flow for exceptions is taken into
account, while others produce graphs abstracting away extra
exception-related edges.

There are unsynchronized objects in there now. Do we want toolkits.graph to
be thread-safe?
