SECTION General Options
#######################

BOPT optimize
false
When this option is set to true, Shimple-based optimizations are applied.
END

SECTION Options for Building Shimple
#################################################

BOPT scalars-only
false
If set to true, SSA will be computed for scalars only (PrimType).  Otherwise,
SSA is computed for both scalars (PrimType) and objects (RefType. Note: 
object aliasing is not taken into account).  Arrays are not handled either
way.
END

SECTION Options for Leaving Shimple
#######################################################

BOPT naive-phi-elimination
false
If set to true, neither pre-optimization nor post-optimization will be applied
to the Phi elimination process.  Note that setting this option to true takes
precedence over other Phi elimination options.
END

BOPT pre-optimize-phi-elimination
false
If set to true, some optimizations are applied before Phi nodes are eliminated.
END

BOPT post-optimize-phi-elimination
true
If set to false, optimizations are not applied after eliminating Phi nodes.
END
